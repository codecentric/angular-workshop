# Exercise 1 - Komponenten Struktur

Let's take a look at the LineChart example from `ng2-charts`

https://valor-software.com/ng2-charts/#/LineChart

Exercise:
 1. move the chart and chart-config to a presentational component 
 2. move the table to a presentational component
 3. add a click event to the chart which triggers the `randomize` method

Note: the `randomize()` method should remain in the parent-component


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
