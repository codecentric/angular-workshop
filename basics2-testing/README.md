# Basics 2 - testing

We use the project setup that we created in the first exercise (with just a bit more added complexity) to take a look at unittests in Angular

### Exercise:
1. run the tests

### Hints:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
